## ðŸ’» Software & Examples

### Raspberry Pi: pigpio Port

For direct use of the BME690 on a Raspberry Pi, a dedicated port of the Bosch SensorAPI is provided in the [`api/`](api/) directory. This port is based on the [pigpio](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/) library and allows direct control of the sensor via the Pi's GPIOs.

ðŸ‘‰ For installation, build instructions, and example applications, see the section [Getting Started on Raspberry Pi](api/README.md#getting-started-on-raspberry-pi) in the API README.

The pigpio port includes several example programs for different measurement modes and is tailored for use with the Raspberry Pi hardware.

Bosch provides software on their [BME688 and BME690 software page](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/software-tools/software/bme688-and-bme690-software/).

They also provide a [BME690 Sensor API](https://github.com/boschsensortec/BME690_SensorAPI) on GitHub.
